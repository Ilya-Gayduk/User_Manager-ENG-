# User_Manager-ENG-
User_Manager(shell script TUI)
In general, nothing grandiose. A small script with pseudographics to work with users in Linux systems. Based on the dialog utility.

At the moment, the script is unfinished, due to the lack of background and the presence of laziness from the author.
